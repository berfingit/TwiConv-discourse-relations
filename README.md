# TwiConv-discourse-relations
TwiConv is a corpus of Twitter conversations (Twitter threads) annotated for PDTB-style coherence relations. Unfortunately, due to Platform X's (formerly Twitter) Developer policy, we are unable to distribute the tweet contents. For access to the annotated tweets in this dataset, please visit https://github.com/berfingit/TwiConv.

The annotations were made using the PDTB annotator tool, and in this repository, we only provide the stand-off annotations in the format generated by the PDTB annotator tool. This data can be used solely for computing statistical information from the annotations. However, unfortunately, the annotations cannot be linked to the tweet contents.

Should there be any changes in the data distribution policy of Platform X, we will update the repository to include the tweet contents.
